# MaxScript
Linux Script Collection (Python, Bash, Arduino etc...)

This collection of scripts in Python, Bash, etc. for free. ANY person can use/distribution and modification.
The collection was created on the initiative of the author and does not claim uniqueness or exclusivity of the material. 
All the presented (shared) material is created for familiarization and does not call for any illegal actions.
It is planned to constantly replenish the collection whenever possible - it all depends on the employment of the author and volunteers :))

PS: 
Only the "dead" fish swims with the current!!! 
We do not stop there... ever!...
